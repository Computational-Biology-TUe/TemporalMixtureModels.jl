# Regularized Regression Components
The `TemporalMixtureModels.jl` package includes support for regularized regression components, specifically Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. These components are useful when dealing with multicollinearity or when you want to perform variable selection in your regression models. The regularized regression components extend the basic polynomial regression model by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
